# Brief Description of the Approach

- Component Structure: The application is structured using React functional components

- State Management: React hooks (useState, useEffect) are used for managing state and side effects.

- Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application, ensuring it is responsive and user-friendly across different devices.

- API Integration: The application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on city name or userâ€™s current location.

# Known Issues Limitations

 - Geolocation: If the user denies geolocation permissions, the application cannot fetch the current location's weather data.

 - API Limits: The application relies on the OpenWeatherMap free tier, which has limitations on the number of requests per minute.

 - Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented, but could be enhanced for better user feedback.
